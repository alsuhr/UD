## For a list of dependencies (closed-class), get the list and counts of words
## in that class.
1. Make a directory which will include lists of acceptable words for each
   dependency type.
2. In this directory, make one file per dependency, named the dependency name.
   For example, you might have a file called "cop" and another called "case".
3. For each dependency file, add in whatever words you consider acceptable for
   that dependency. Files may be empty (but must exist).
4. Make a list of dependencies you want to check -- one per file you created
   in the directory. This file should have one dependency name per line.

closed_class_dependencies.py
  file -- the file to look at for examples of words (e.g. fr-ud-train.conllu)
  wordlist_prefix -- the name of the directory you created with the acceptable
      words. Must include a "/" at the end.
  dependency_list -- a file including the list of dependencies you want to
      check.
  output_prefix -- the prefix for an output directory. A new file will be
      created for each dependency, including each word and the count which was
      marked with that dependency. Must include a "/" at the end.

## Get the dependency types for a given word.
This script will, for each word you provide, count up the number of times it is
marked for each dependency. It will output a section per word and include the
marked dependencies and counts.

func_dep_count.py
  filename -- the file to look in for a particular word.
  wordlist -- a file containing a list of words to look at the dependency types
      of.
